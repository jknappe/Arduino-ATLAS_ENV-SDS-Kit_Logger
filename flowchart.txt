Flowchart for Arduino-ATLAS_ENV-SDS-Kit_Logger

SETUP
- initialize RTC with compilation time
- check if SD card present/initialize
- check files on SD card
- create new data file
- open data file on SD
- indicate start of program on LED (blink)

LOOP
- take current time
- turn on sensor multiplexer with i sensors
	- turn on sensor i
	- wait specified settling time for sensor i
	- measure sensor i
	- switch off sensor i
	- save sensor i reading in variable
	- turn on to sensor i+1 ...
- tun off multiplexer sensor data
- write data to SD card/print to console


TODO
- add bluetooth communication
- read T and salinity and pressure compensation for DO readings
- add error handling
